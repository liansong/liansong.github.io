				<h1>Morning Mates</h1>

				<div id="main-content">

				<p class="content">This was a project initially conceived for a design challenge as a part of my application to Berkeley Innovation. The prompt was as follows:<br><br> 
				
				<em>Consider the experience of waking up. Define a user problem and propose a design solution.</em><br><br>

				My initial submission consisted of a set of powerpoint slides, shown <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zjukK5TG0FdPzAK1k3KEgnsj2QB6r1-SPAyDsI7c1X8/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>, but I thought it would be a good exercise to follow through and take my original proposal through the iterative design process.
				</p>

				<h1>The Problem</h1>

				<p class="content">I am terrible at waking up. I’ve tried everything &mdash; my typical alarm requires two digit multiplication to shut off, and it vibrates like mad. As much as a value punctuality, it’s become second nature to shut off my alarm(s) and simply fall back asleep.<br><br>

				That’s a big problem.<br><br>

				So when I was presented with this design challenge, I decided to approach it by first considering the perspective of the user &mdash; in this case, me.<br><br>

				What I realized was that this wasn’t an alarm-side issue; rather, it was a matter of motivation. I noticed, for instance, that I was very capable of waking up for morning appointments and tests &mdash; the fear of missing social obligations was enough to make me heed my alarm. Indeed, it had become a sort of a habit to ask a friend to call me in the morning and make sure I was awake, because knowing there was someone on the other end of the line sufficient social motivation.</p>

				<h1>User Research &amp; Refinement</h1>

				<p class="content">No good design would be complete without user research, and even with the limited time that I had, I aimed to interview as many people as I could. The primary insights I gleaned are as shown:</p>

				<h1>The Initial Solution</h1>

				<p class="content">“Social”, I noticed, was the key word in these early considerations. Moving forward, what I hoped to do was communalize the morning process, by creating a local network to hold one another accountable. My solution would be a mobile application, and my target audience would be a college floor, similar the one I currently live in. A bit of a niche application, sure, but I thought it would be fun to make it anyways.<br><br>

				Ultimately, I settled on two primary functionalities for this application: </p>

				<ol>

				<li>Calling Companions &mdash; match morning schedules with people on your floor, and hold each other accountable based on these matches. </li>
				<br>
				<li>Breakfast Buddies &mdash; plan and eat breakfast with floormates; nothing starts your morning like a good breakfast with friends!</li>

				</ol>
