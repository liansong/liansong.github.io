	    	<h3>Introduction</h3>

	    	<br>

	    	<p>Berkeley is fortunate to have some pretty fantastic public transportation, covering a huge swath of the East Bay from Richmond to Berkeley, down past Oakland and finally into the South Bay. It’s an incredible public service, and one that unfortunately isn’t utilized as often as it should be &mdash; I can’t count the times that I’ve walked or Uber-ed somewhere, only to realize later that the bus would’ve taken me there free of cost. So why weren’t more people making using of the public transportation at Berkeley?</p>

	    	<h3>The Problem</h3>

	    	<br>

	    	<p>I spoke with several people about their interaction with the AC Transit system, if they had any at all. I primarily sought to identify the roadblocks users faced when trying to access the bus system, and how a design solution could encourage further engagement with AC Transit. My focus was on students — at UC Berkeley, students get free rides on the bus, removing monetary constraints and allowing me to expand the problem space.<br><br>A common trend that I found was that many students had used the bus system once or twice, before simply stopping altogether. They noted that while the bus system was convenient, it simply wasn’t reliable enough, and they weren’t able to keep track of what the times the bus was there. Ultimately, it wasn’t worth the hassle. This was understandable; a quick foray into the AC Transit website yielded intimidating, spreadsheet-esque timetables and frustration. The mobile options seemed equally limited; especially on Android, I saw these same spreadsheets, only... smaller. To fit on the mobile screens, I suppose.</p>

	    	<br><br>

	    	<p>What the users needed was a more efficient and reliable way to access information on the timing of bus stops and the location of bus stops. Only with this, I realized, could people begin to build trust in the bus system. I decided that the best solution would be to design a mobile app, as a way to deliver information straight to a user’s phone — convenient, especially on the go.</p>

			<br>

	    	<h3>The Process</h3>

	    	<br>

			<p>I began with wireframes, on paper. Timeless. I quickly filled up a couple pages, mostly focused on the interaction between map and navigation; I wanted the flow between the two parts to be seamless and without friction. I then headed to my prototyping tool of choice, Figma (equivalent to Sketch), pretty quickly, running through potential designs and duplicating freely to create new branches, as I iterated on new features and designs.</p>

	  		<h3>The Solution</h3>

	  		<br>

	  		<p>What I ultimately hoped to achieve was a mobile app that could not only encourage the exploration of the bus system, but also provide reliable and easily parsable information on bus times and locations, especially for regular users of the system who depended primarily on only one or two bus lines. In order to achieve this, I chose to make the application open to the map, complete with pointers for bus stations and the current location of the user. 

	  		To me, transportation of any kind is first and foremost a visual and pictorial experience, which is why I wanted to put the map front and center, allowing people to quickly find nearby bus stops based on their location. App navigation, I hoped, would be peripheral, and complementary to interaction with the main map.</p>

	  		<br><br>

	  		<p>The starting screen is simply a map, front and center. In reality, there are 4 ways to interact with the map &mdash; by entering a location pin, choosing one of the two buttons on the bottom right, or interacting with any notifications on the top that may exist. The options are clear, and as much room is given to the visual map as possible. Upon clicking any of the location pins, the user will be taken to a pop up tab from the bottom, which will detail all of the bus lines that run through that location, as well as glanceable information for those in a hurry.</p>
