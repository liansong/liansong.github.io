			  		<p class="content">In building a recognizable brand and message for Berkeley Innovation's Fall 2017 recruitment season, I was lucky to work alongside <a href="https://www.karenchoudesign.com/">Karen Chou</a>, aiming to develop a consistent theme supported by a set of design assets.<br><br>Our goal was to convey a sense of community &mdash; how thinkers, designers, tinkerers of all stripes come together and belong at Berkeley Innovation. This manifested quite literally, with our logo reimagined as a three dimensional space, depicting members interacting and acting in various steps of the design process: ideating, iterating, interviewing.</p>
