			  		<h4>Product Design Intern, Summer 2017</h4>

			  		<div id="main-content">

			  		<p class="content">During the summer of 2017, I served as a Product Design intern at Rainforest QA, a startup in San Francisco aiming to automate the quality assurance process through a combination of crowdsouring and machine learning. Over the course of 11 weeks, I redesigned several key interactions, assisted in building and implementing a new design language, and helped define scalable design processes at Rainforest.</p>
