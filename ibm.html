            <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

            <p>This past summer, I had the wonderful opportunity to intern at IBM’s Austin Design Studio as a part of a multidisciplinary product team of five interns. Through an IBM partnership with the International Society for Infectious Diseases (ISID), my team and <b>I explored how mobile technology could improve the experience of healthcare workers in infection prevention and control</b>.

            <br><br>

            Throughout the summer, I drove product design on my team — I worked on needfinding, ideation and prototyping, user testing, and visual design. I dove deep into the world of infectious diseases — working daily with ISID and interacting with a score of physicians and medical experts across the globe.</p>


        	<h3>The Problem</h3>

        	<p>The problem was presented as follows:

            <br><br>

            <b>How might we empower healthcare workers and communities in low-middle income countries to better address infection prevention and control (IPC)?</b>

            <br><br>

            As the International Society for Infectious Diseases (ISID) told us:

            <br><br>

            “Despite major advances in the ability to detect, track, and manage infections, <b>there continues to be a lack of resources available for healthcare workers (HWs) in low and middle income countries</b> that are free, up-to-date, and focus on implementing infection prevention and control (IPC) across a variety of resource settings.”

            <br><br>

            As is, <b>ISID has published and maintained their Guide to Infection Control in the same format for over 20 years</b> — a dense, hard to parse handbook covering a wide range of the IPC lifecycle. This was our opportunity: to rethink this Guide, leveraging mobile technology and ISID's expertise to create a more effective tool for IPC.</p>


            <h3>Generative Research</h3>

            <p>With this initial problem statement in mind, we jumped into research, investigating four key areas:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>The current state of infection prevention and control in low resource settings</b> — what problems currently exist, and what resources are available?</li>
                <li><b>The opportunity that mobile technology presents in healthcare</b> — what solutions could we provide?</li>
                <li><b>The actors involved in health care in low resource settings</b> — who are we designing for?</li>
                <li><b>The resources and expertise that ISID has access to</b> — what was most feasible given the resources at hand?</li>
            </ol>

            <p>With this secondary research I was looking to go broad, hoping for a clearer understanding of the general problem space of IPC — some of my research reports can be viewed <a href="https://berkeley.app.box.com/s/x415l9v0ulal5756gvhadrb8ypdxv51t">here</a>. During our research, <b>we decided to focus primarily on sub-Saharan Africa, because the most low resource ISID users came from this region</b> (Nigeria in particular having the most, due to the English speaking population).

            <br><br>

           Towards the end of this generative process, I <b>synthesized this research into three main spaces that we could move forward with:</b></p>

           <ol>
                <li>IPC Education — <b>Employing ISID’s wealth of knowledge in order to provide a more accessible educational experience</b>, aiming to better support health care workers with less access to educational opportunity. This would focus especially on the first persona.</li>
                <li>Infectious disease diagnosis and treatment decision making — <b>Supporting physicians during the diagnosis and treatment of an infectious disease case</b>, using smart decision trees and natural language. This would focus primarily on the physician persona.</li>
                <li>3. Best practices and antimicrobial stewardship — <b>Improving the dissemination and accessibility of IPC best practices</b>, focusing on the general prevention of infectious disease in a health care facility. This would focus on the nurse and doctor persona, and their daily practice.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>These directions each targeted different aspects of the infection prevention and control lifecycle, and leveraged different aspects of ISID’s expertise.</p>


            <h3>Our Design Opportunity</h3>

            <p>At this point, we asked ourselves — where could we make the most impact, as designers and through ISID? <b>We decided to move forward with the third space, focusing our project on best practices and antimicrobial stewardship.</b>

            <br><br>

            With this problem space came with a set of constraints:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>The user <b>would need some formal training in medicine</b> — most of the existing ISID material we were planning to leverage required some sort of medical education</li>
                <li>The user <b>would be embedded within a larger health care facility</b> — most of ISID’s expertise focused on the hospital setting; furthermore, we found that IPC could be most effectively addressed in the context of a hospital, and would allow us to design for specific personas and use cases</li>
                <li>The user <b>would need to have access to a mobile smartphone</b> — this was a technological limitation, and we found that health care workers are generally comfortable employing mobile technology, and excited to adopt it</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Key Insights</h3>

            <p>Over the course of our project, we <b>spoke with over a dozen health care workers from low resource countries</b>, primarily Africa and Asia. I was also able to leverage IBM’s connections, setting up interviews with IBM employed health care experts in Nigeria. This research allowed us to move forward with several key insights.</p>

            <ol>
                <li><b>IPC information created in high resource settings does not adequately translate to low resource settings.</b> Literature from high resource settings assumes access to a wide range of medical equipment and training, which healthcare systems in low resource countries often do not support.</li>
                <li><b>Hospitals in low resource countries often have very little staff with formal training in infection prevention and control.</b> Infection prevention and control (and, more generally, medical) education in Africa is limited and often inconsistent. Those who do have this knowledge are stretched very thin, and are called upon very frequently by other doctors to consult in the case of a potential infectious disease — even for basic cases.</li>
                <li>In many hospitals, <b>there is often no centralized and always accessible static resource for infection prevention and control</b>, and basic information related to IPC best practices is often hard to find. This is exacerbated by the first pain point — we found that doctors in Africa often pulled from high resource medical literature, but fail to translate to their setting.</li>
                <li><b>Existing IPC resources are often not immediately actionable</b>. This is seen even with the existing ISID Guide to Infection Control, which was hard to parse, and tended to be theoretical, rather and practical.</li>
            </ol>


            <h3>Personas</h3>

            <p>Working with the user researcher on my team to synthesize his research results, we created personas of the health care workers we would be designing for. These personas were Ife the Infection Control Specialist, and Dayo the Doctor.</p>

            <p>#1, Ife the Infection Control Specialist<br>Ife can share her knowledge of infection control best practices with nurses and doctors in her hospital without being there in person, which allows her focus on the more complex cases.</p>

            <p>#2, Dayo the Doctor<br>Dayo and his team are able to implement general infection prevention and control best practices in a localized setting without the physical presence of infection control personnel.</p>


            <h3>Our Solution</h3>

            <p>Following from these personas, I finalized the concept for our solution: <b>a mobile application that serves as a shared workspace</b> connecting Ife the Infection Control Specialist and Dayo the Doctor, enabling Ife to <b>scale her expertise of IPC in her particular hospital setting</b>, by easily creating and publishing short articles on IPC best practices. In turn, Dayo is able to <b>more easily access this information and implement it in his daily workflow</b>, without having to speak with Ife.</p>


            <h3>Ideation</h3>

            <p>Armed a provisional solution and with our user research, some of my major considerations at the stage were as follows:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>What would be the most basic unit of content, and how would users prefer to consume this? What length was most feasible, both for content consumption and creation?</li>
                <li>How could this information be best parsed in order to maximize its efficiency? How could IPC information be most easily understood at a glance and then applied by a health care worker?</li>
                <li>What formats of IPC information currently exist (e.g. step by step instructions vs. tables vs. plain text), and how could different formats of IPC content be accommodated visually, and in a consistent manner?</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Iteration</h3>

            <p>At the center of my design was the article — either a post created by the infection control specialist, or a section from an ISID chapter. When surfaced from a search result, these articles would be presented as cards — each card would be summarized dynamically with a relevant sentence from the article, which would be surfaced based on relevant keywords. Based on our testing, this format best supported our user goals, enabling easy searchability and scanability.

            <br><br>

            We also explored different methods of content organization for Ife to better categorize content, and we investigated how to best manage and encourage feedback between Ife and Dayo.</p>



            <h3>Iteration</h3>

            <p>After this first iteration of the application, we set up a set of user testing, aiming primarily to validate the concept that we had created. Through testing, we wanted to better understand:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Would our design solution actually be helpful and useful throughout a user’s day to day? Most importantly, we wanted to validate</li>
                <li>Relevant information varies based on health worker and location in the hospital — how could more relevant information be surfaced based on the user searching?</li>
                <li>Hospitals are organized in many ways — to best capture this model, what sort of directory system was needed, if any? For instance, would a folder system labeled as different wings of the hospital be useful?</li>
            </ol>

            <p>We approached testing with two methods — the first was evaluative research, through calls and screen sharing with users we has developed a relationship with, and the second was through UserTesting.com, filtering for those located in low resource settings with some past experience in medicine. The intent with these two methods were for validation and usability, respectively. Overall, we received very positive feedback on the concept of the app! Some key insights emerged from this testing:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Support for other forms of media (i.e. photos, video) was critical — we underestimated how valuable users found them to be</li>
                <li>References were important, and users wanted to be able to ensure that their knowledge was empirically verified and trustworthy — in this vein, clearly displaying the author and the publisher was crucial</li>
                <li>Several users weren’t sure how helpful comments were, and stated that other methods of communication might be more useful (e.g. direct messaging)</li>
                <li>We found that infection control specialists generally wouldn’t want to edit existing ISID articles, and would prefer to create their own, using ISID’s articles as a starting point</li>
            </ul>


            <h3>Final Iteration</h3>

            <p class="end-div">Incorporating these testing insights, I finalized and compiled a set of screens for presentation and hand off to ISID, along with an app style guide and component library based on ISID’s branding guidelines. These screens can be found on Invision here, along with some animations that I created here.
            <br><br>I also worked with the two devs on my team to implement these designs into an MVP coded prototype, which we were also able to hand off to ISID! Huge shout out to the developers on my team 😊
            <br><br>I was very eager to think more about the future opportunities that an application of this sort would open up — unfortunately, I didn’t have time during the scope of this internship! Moving forward with ISID, we discussed potential future goals — for instance, sharing customized content with others in your locale, crowdsourcing local infection information, and integrating with ISID’s database of active infectious disease outbreaks.</p>
