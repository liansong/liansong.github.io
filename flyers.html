			  		<h1>Women in Computer Science</h1>
			  		<br>

			  		<img src="assets/stylesheets/images/visual/wcs2.png" class="fly" alt="women in cs" style="margin-left: -40px;"></img><!--

			  		--><p class="content fly-p-r">A logo I created for the Women in Computer Science club at UIUC. The inspiration for this design came from the need to include women within the CS community â€” with this logo, I approached that quite literally; the face is within the â€˜Câ€™ and the â€˜Sâ€™ formed by the hair.</p>

			  		<h1>Monta Vista Senior Ball</h1>
			  		<br>

			  		<img src="assets/stylesheets/images/visual/senior ball.jpg" class="fly" alt="senior ball flyer"></img><!--

			  		--><p class="content fly-p-r">An informational flyer that doubled as a ticket, handed out to attendees of my high schoolâ€™s Senior Ball. The skyline at the bottom is the San Francisco skyline, advertising the location of the event â€” on a cruise ship in the SF bay. The event was wonderful, if you were wondering (I planned it!).</p>

			  		<h1>Berkeley Innovation Career Fair</h1>
			  		<br>

			  		<img src="assets/stylesheets/images/visual/career fairr.jpg" class="fly" alt="career fair flyer"></img><!--

			  		--><p class="content fly-p-r">A promotional flyer created for the Berkeley Innovation Design Career Fair, which I planned and organized. Also obligatory plug &mdash; if you or your company is interested in <a href="https://berkeleyinnovation.org/partner">working with Berkeley Innovation</a>, shoot me an email! We do cool stuff ðŸ˜….</p>

			  		<h1>CED Undergrad Student Council</h1>

			  		<img src="assets/stylesheets/images/visual/ced2.png" class="fly" alt="ced"></img><!--

			  		--><p class="content fly-p-r">A set of logos that I created for the CED Undergraduate Student Council at UC Berkeley â€” two color options and one monochrome option. The colors are meant to represent the fields of study that come together under CED, and the monochrome represents common patterns seen in architectural tools.</p>
