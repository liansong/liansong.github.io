        		<h1>Women in Computer Science</h1>
            <p>A logo I created for the Women in Computer Science club at UIUC. The inspiration for this design stemmed from a desire to visually portray women as belonging within the CS community. I approached that quite literally with this logo &mdash; the face is between the ‘C’ and the ‘S’ formed by the hair.</p>

            <h1>Monta Vista Senior Ball</h1>
            <p>An informational flyer that doubled as a ticket, handed out to attendees of my high school’s Senior Ball. The skyline at the bottom is the San Francisco skyline, advertising the location of the event — on a cruise ship in the SF bay. The event was wonderful, if you were wondering (I planned it!).</p>

            <h1>CED Undergrad Student Council</h1>
            <p>A set of logos that I created for the CED Undergraduate Student Council at UC Berkeley &mdash; a colored option and a monochrome option. The colors are meant to represent the fields of study that come together under CED, and the monochrome represents common patterns seen in architectural tools.</p>
