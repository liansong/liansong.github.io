				<p class="content t">This was a short project that I created for Dive In, a local start up focused on community organization. The goal was to recreate their event portal, so I quickly created wireframes and went straight to a mid-fi prototype.

				<h1>Points of Improvement</h1>

				<p class="content t">The original event page was very barebones; nothing egregious, but certainly nothing to write home about. What I found most troubling was a lack of structure; the content simply stacked from the top down, providing no obvious entry points. I also noted a lack of consistency with regards to font usage, and I wanted to tidy that up. Beyond that, I thought that there was room for more information, perhaps presented in a more interactive manner. I began by drawing a set of wireframes, aimed at revamping the page:</p>

				<p class="content t">This project wasn't meant to be anything intensive, so from there, I decided to jump straight to creating a mid-fi prototype using Figma.</p>

				<h1>Mid-fi Prototype</h1>

				<p class="content">I decided to maintain the same color scheme and most of the same information as the original event portal. I focused primarily on the placement and layout of information, especially emphasizing the "Register" button and providing a clear call to action throughout the page. I also expanded the page to include more detailed information underneath the fold, while keeping the main points clear and accessible above the fold. Notice how a register button persists on the bottom of the page after scrolling down; this is meant to provide an always accessible entry point.</p>
