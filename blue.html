        <p>We keep going, more stuff. Made a poster, made some fun stuff, mostly wasted time.<br><br>My friend told me that I think a lot, and some people never do. It was meant to be comforting, what they said. I don't believe it.<br><br>I want to write more, I want to write, and the more I think about it the more I think writing must be the highest, the most beautiful, the most towering edifice of these humanist artforms, a breathless banishment of imagery altogether, a destrictive sublimation of the world to the cold rationality of the modern typeface, a cancerous bloom in that damp damp basement you left long ago, maybe the only that might make me feel better.<br><br>I've got some decisions to make. I want fresh air.</p>

        <h2>Week #5 or 6 or 7 &mdash; A Poster</h2>
        <p>For Berkeley Innovation's upcoming HCD conference. I made this and liked it and then I realized that I hated it, but that's alright that's alright, that's just life. I wanted to create something professional and trendy but still meaningful, whatever the hell that means. Can something professional still be meaningful? If you asked me today I would probably say no, but I tried anyways. Hey, how did this make you feel at first glance? Did you think anything at all, or was it just blobs and lines to you? Look harder, does it mean anything now? Let me know, I'm really curious. I explain a bit of my thought below, but hold on to your first impression please.</p>

        <p style="color: white;">The metaphor behind this is to visually demonstrate meaning (the black lines) being created above and across ambiguity (the yellow blobs), though I'm sure that's not apparent. Did you think that was apparent?</p>

    		<h2>Week #1 &mdash; A Manifesto</h2>
            <p>
                <em>What's your end goal?</em>
                <br>A totally bizarro 3d project with absolutely <em>no</em> practical application.
                <br><br><em>What are you working on?</em>
                <br>Three.js, Blender
                <br><br><em>What inspires you?</em>
                <br>Rhizomes, mushrooms, capitalist ruin, anxiety, the fact that vegetarian omega-3 is ridiculously expensive, <a href="https://threejs.org">sample examples</a>.
                <br><br><em>What are you working towards?</em>
                <br>I want to develop my voice and personal style as a designer, and I also want to consider the way three dimensions can be used to reconceptualize the way that we typically understand visual design and interfaces.
                <br><br><em>If you get stuck, what approaches can you try?</em>
                <br>&mdash; Block out genuinely productive time to learn the fundamentals.
                <br>&mdash; Make something every (other) day, even if it's not 3d.
                <br>&mdash; Work out small individual interactions, don't worry about how they come together.
                <br><br><em>What will you be looking for during our check-ins?</em>
                <br>&mdash; Week 4: Start something.
                <br>&mdash; Week 6: Give up on the last thing, most likely.
                <br>&mdash; Week 8: Do something else.
                <br>&mdash; Week 10: Throw all 3 of the previous things into 1 poorly conceived jambalaya
