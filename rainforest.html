  		<h1>Rainforest QA</h1>
  		<h4>Product Design Intern, Summer 2017</h4>

  		<div id="main-content">

  		<p class="content">During the summer of 2017, I served as a Product Design Intern at Rainforest QA, a startup in San Francisco aiming to automate the quality assurance process through a combination of crowdsouring and machine learning. Over the course of 11 weeks, I redesigned several key interactions, assisted in implementing a new design language, and helped define scalable design processes at Rainforest.</p>

  		<p class="content t">As a startup, the team at Rainforest was small, and the product team even smaller; in fact, the design team consisted primarily of my manager and I. I also collaborated with PMs, Customer Success Managers, and engineers throughout my time at Rainforest.</p>

  		<h1>Defining the Problem</h1>

  		<p class="content">When I joined as an intern, the product team was in the middle of creating and deploying Rainforest 2.0: a comprehensive rethinking of functionality and user flows across the Rainforest platform, paired with a new UI design language. Throughout my internship, I worked on applying this new design language throughout the platform, and improved and redesigned interactions for Rainforest 2.0 according to user needs.</p>

  		<p class="content t">To ensure broad QA coverage, Rainforest needed to be uniquely adaptable to each customers' platform. However, the scope of a test that could be on run on Rainforest was necessarily narrow, covering one particular set of steps in one particular environment. This required many variables to be specified &mdash; to run a typical test, a user had to consider:</p>

  		<ol>

  		<li>The site against which the test would be executed against.</li>
  		<li>Which browser(s) and browser versions the test would be run on.</li>
  		<li>What set of testers the test would be run by.</li>

  		</ol>

  		<p class="content t">All in all, a complex set of considerations for a pretty basic task.</p>

  		<h1>The Problem</h1>

  		<p class="content"><strong>Users reported numerous frustrations in managing the complexity of settings across Rainforest, especially when trying to specify and manage variables (e.g. when running a test).</strong> During my time at Rainforest, I focused specifically on the Settings pages, where users were able to configure the Rainforest platform exactly to the product needs, as well as specify default settings.</p>

  		<h1>Understanding Rainforest</h1>

  		<p class="content">My first step was to map and understand the ins and outs of the Rainforest platform &mdash; this was my first encounter with the field of quality assurance, and I spent my first couple weeks learning everything I could about quality assurance, and all of the variables that factored into the execution of a test on Rainforest.</p>

  		<p class="content t">I also spoke to PMs about the main personas that engaged with the platform. My work at Rainforest was focused one persona in particular &mdash; the "Individual Contributer".

  		<h1 class="t">Sites &amp; Environments</h1>

  		<p class="content">My first project was to improve the interaction of Sites &amp; Environments, which</p>
