            <h3>HCD Design Conference</h3>

            <p>In Spring 2018, Berkeley Innovation put on our annual HCD Design Conference, bringing in a range of industry speakers on campus to talk design. This year, our theme was <em>Making Meaning</em> &mdash; how design is always charged with epistemic consequences. In addition to helping put on the event, I also created the marketing materials. My goal was to communicate the formation of meaningful concepts from a chaotic inventory of non-meaningful components. This came off rather abstract, with the design elements held in tension, in formation.</p>

	  		<h3>Recruitment</h3>

	  		<p>In building a recognizable brand and message for Berkeley Innovation's Fall 2017 recruitment season, I worked alongside <a href="https://www.karenchou.design/" target="_blank">Karen Chou</a>, aiming to develop a consistent theme supported by a set of design assets.<br><br>Our goal was to convey a sense of community &mdash; how thinkers, designers, tinkerers of all stripes come together and belong at Berkeley Innovation. This manifested quite literally, with our logo reimagined as a three dimensional space, depicting members interacting and acting in various steps of the design process: ideating, iterating, interviewing.</p>

	  		<p class="caption">Completed Flyer</p>

	  		<p>With the designs that we created for the flyer, I built out a series of vector assets that would be used across our social media channels &mdash; for instance, a cover photo.</p>

	  		<p>These assets were also used on the Fall 2017 Recruitment website, coded by our Director of Tech, Kim.</p>

        <h3>Showcase</h3>

        <p>I also created a cover photo for Berkeley Innovation's semesterly Showcase event page, a public event meant to show off the efforts of our consultants.</p>
