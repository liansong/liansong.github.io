          Hiya, welcome to my portfolio! My name's Lian.<br><br>
      		
          A bit about me &mdash; I'm a second year at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1717731545171536/">UC Berkeley</a>, studying Cognitive Science &amp; Design Innovation. Last summer, I worked as a Product Design Intern at <a href="https://www.rainforestqa.com/">Rainforest QA</a>; at school, I serve as External Vice President for <a href="https://berkeleyinnovation.org/">Berkeley Innovation</a>, and previously I was a visual &amp; web designer at <a href="http://innovativedesign.club/">Innovative Design</a>.<br><br>

      		<!--I am fascinated by the blurring lines between technology and human cognition &mdash; in particular, how recent technological advancements have shaped the way in which communities and identities percieve themselves. I am also interested in expression and identity in the tech industry; recently, I attended <a href="http://outforundergrad.org/tech/">O4U Tech</a>, a wonderful conference where I was able to speak to students and professionals about life and authenticity.<br><br>-->

      		In my free time, I'm off shooting <a href="world.html" class="internal" target="_self">photographs</a>, studying <a href="http://pdf-objects.com/files/Heidegger-Martin-Being-and-Time-trans.-Macquarrie-Robinson-Blackwell-1962.pdf">philosophy</a>, sharpening my web design skills, and seeking new spaces to grow and create in. I also adore the beautiful folk singer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FX34TjJe-c">Sufjan Stevens</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2517622/">birds</a> and <a href="https://orionmagazine.org/article/deep-intellect/">octopus</a>, em dashes, and anything written by <a href="http://lithub.com/the-murakami-effect/">Murakami</a>.<br><br>

          I'm currently open for design opportunities and internships for 2018! Feel free to ping me at <a href="mailto:hello@liansong.co" target="_self">hello@liansong.co</a><br><br>

          P.S. If your company might be interested in working with Berkeley Innovation, feel free to reach out! We offer some cool partnership opportunities, such as 10-week consultant projects, as well as on campus tech talks and career fairs.
